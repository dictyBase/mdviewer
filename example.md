# Example Markdown Document

This is an example markdown file to demonstrate the capabilities of the MDViewer application.

## Features Showcase

### Basic Formatting

**Bold text** and *italic text* work perfectly. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ text.

### Code Blocks

Here's some Go code with syntax highlighting:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
    })
    
    fmt.Println("Server starting on :8080")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

Inline code: `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`
